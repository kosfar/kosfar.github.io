Hello sailor!

Bitrot and buffer overflows have been more frequent than usual lately.  This is a tech savvy logbook for stories I consider interesting, not necessarily useful but somewhat hackish and would like to immunise against oblivion.

For posts around daily life, I used to post stuff in my [greek blog](https://kostafari.wordpress.com/){:target="blank"}, but not anymore. Maybe one day, I will come back to it and let you know.

Wish you an adventurous trip!
